## Hi, I'm Ismael!

I'm a Telecommunication engineer by the university of the Basque Country UPV/EHU
experienced in software engineering projects and machine learning who also loves
crafting beautiful UI solutions in my spare time. You can have a look at my
projects in this web page or look into my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/ismaelestalayo/).


<p style="padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">
	So far I've worked as:
</p>
- Designer and developer of [Dataseeds](https://dataseeds.github.io/)

- Software engineer in [Keynetic Technologies](https://keynetic.tech/)

<br>

<p style="padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">
	I've also had the pleasure of publishing two papers related to neural networks:
