This privacy policy governs the use of any of the software applications, web pages and/or services from the developer Ismael Estalayo.

#### **What information does Crypto Tracker collect?**
Through the Microsoft AppCenter Analytics SDK I collect no personal information whatsoever, and solely obtain general information of the device you use and your session within the app (OEM, OS version, language, country, duration and crashes). All the telemetry is anonymized and can not be used to identify any user.

As part of the Windows Store, the app also collects this information to the Microsoft Partner Center by default, but with the same level of anonymization as the previous paragraph.

#### **Your Consent**
By using the web page/application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

#### **Opt-out rights**
You can stop all the collection of information by the application by uninstalling it, and no personal information that could be used to identify you was ever collected.

#### **Contact Us**
If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at [ismael.em@outlook.com](mailto:ismael.em@outlook.com).
