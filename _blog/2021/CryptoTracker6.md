After months in the work the 6th big update of CryptoTracker is finally out AND is part of the incredible [Launch 2021](https://uwpcommunity.com/launch/2021/) event, the third annual event of its kind where the UWP community comes together and releases their projects into the wild.
As an already existing app, CryptoTracker has been updated packed with **new features**, a huge **UI overhaul** and a faster and cleaner code (thanks to the MVVM toolkit).

But before diving into all the changes, this is also a moment to celebrate multiple milestones. In the one hand, this year has been the first one with **user donations** for which I'm incredibly greateful for; and in the other hand, just a week before its 4th anniversary the app reached the **50k acquisitions** achievement!

## Changelog

Some of them were long overdue (i'm looking at you Live Tiles and Compact Overlay), while others were smaller requests or ideas I've gotten and put aside because of university.

After a long hiatus without any important new features, this new update is filled with them (and the obvious bugfixes along the way):

Simple yet powerful cryptocurrency portfolio tracker designed with simplicity and functionality in mind.

- Minimal yet powerful cryptocurrency portfolio tracker designed with simplicity and functionality in mind.
- Choose from over 800 crypto and 15 fiat currencies
- Personal finance tracker that helps you manage your portfolio of cryptocurrencies in a single place.
- Follow the evolution of cryptocurrency markets
- Track all your cryptocurrency holdings in one place
- Simply add your transactions to the app, and let it track its earnings
- Conversion tool between any currency


### New Home layout
The double column layout is gone, combining the price and volume charts into a single stylish card. This also results in an easier spotting of volume trends with price fluctuations:
