For a while I've seen here and there bits of information about Microsoft's Azure and specially about its free tier. But nonetheless, I've never really tried looking into it for more than five minutes straight, both because of how easy procrastinating is, and because of how complex and intimidating Azure's portal can look once you log in. After too much delaying, I finally gave it my full attention, and got a working Telegram bot hosted on Azure for free. 

*This won't be a tutorial about how to make a Telegram bot, but about how to host it on Azure.*
