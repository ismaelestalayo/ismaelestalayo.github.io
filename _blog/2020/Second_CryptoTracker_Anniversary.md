On the summer of 2017 I decided I wanted to create a Windows app as a fun summer-project, and for that I started learning C# and XAML via [this](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Windows-10-development-for-absolute-beginners) video tutorials. Now, two years after not only starting to learn, but actually creating and uploading to the Microsoft store my first ever app, I decided to take a look back to see how the app has evolved during all this time both functionality wise, as well as

For the past few years I've always had a summer project in between university courses where to invest some free hours here and there. At the beggining, with almost no programming knowledge, I started tinkering with an Arduino. Next year I decided I wanted to not be involved with hardware, so I decided to take further the thing we learn of Java at university (and thus [uMessenger](https://github.com/ismaelestalayo/uMessenger2.0) was born).

But on the summer of 2017, I concluded I wanted something a bit more complex and more focused on end-users (and not an .exe file that people should have to download from my GitHub). Hence, I decided to learn how to program apps

On the summer of 2017 I decided I wanted to start learing how to make apps, and as in that time my current phone was an iPhone 6S and my computer ran Windows, I could either learn Swift to develop for iOS or C# (plus XAML) to develop for Windows. Soon enough I learnt that having a Mac was (and still is) obligatory to compile iOS apps, so my choice was clear. I started lurking through the web searching for a good UWP tutorial, and I ended up using [Bob Tabor's tutorial](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Windows-10-development-for-absolute-beginners) (also available in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi2hbezQRVS0cPMeW3uDlUHnO_rPvJCV9))
